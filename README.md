# Predicting Severity of Road Accidents Using Road Accident Records

## About

This is our Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) where we apply course knowledge to real-world applications. Our project uses data from the [Road Accidents CSV and EXCEL dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdulmannann/road-accidents-csv) on Kaggle to predict accident severity based on environmental settings.
